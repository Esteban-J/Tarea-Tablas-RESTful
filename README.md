# Práctica| Mi primera aplicación con NPM

This program is a Node.js aplication introductory to the use of the [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) framework to generate a basic web app development file structure and to the implementation of the [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) arquitecture style for web development as well.

The application makes use of HTTP methods to recieve data by the net requests and use such data to do simple math operations.

- **POST** => multiply n1 and n2
- **GET** => sum n1 and n2
- **PUT** => divide n1 and n2
- **PATCH** => power n1 by n2
- **DELETE** => substraction n1 and n2
